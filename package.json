I want to be prompted with a login or sign up prompt when I open the page for the first time. If I am a returning member then I will login and see all the most recent questions asked by other site members. If I am new member I will sign in then see the most recent questions asked by other site members. I am given an option on the page to ask a question and post it. If I click on a question then I am prompted with all the other users answers to that specific question.",
